1) [dbo].[getAcidStd] - has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]
2) ****** [dbo].[getAnalysisStd] - defines sequenceId variable as VARCHAR(12)... this is an issue because sequenceId's are always VARCHAR(36) so the scalar function never returns anything. Also has 0 dependencies.. deprecated?
3) ****** [dbo].[getAnalyte] - Always returns the same value. (Zr). No matter the input Analysis. Skipping this one for now
4) [dbo].[getBatchFile] - has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]
5) [dbo].[getCal] - has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]
6) ****** [dbo].[getCalId] - seems like it is deprecated? also allows to be called when sampletype is '' (empty) and does some weird stuff with selecting discover data and calibration data... doesnt seem correct. 
7) ****** [dbo].[getCalStdVal] - cannot run the equality test because the scalar function contains dynamic SQL. 
8) ****** [dbo].[getCalType] - deprecated. Not used.
9) [dbo].[getDisplayName] - has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
10) [dbo].[getFastMethod_S5] returns VARCHAR(40) whereas all other fast method returns return VARCHAR(50). 
11) [dbo].[getHostName] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX].
12) ****** [dbo].[getPointMethodId] is no longer used. The table it references does not exist.
13) [dbo].[getQCItemValidated] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX].
14) ****** [dbo].[getRelativeValue] is not used..? it calls for dvalue and evalue and they are never set so it always returns "NaN" or null. 
15) ****** [dbo].[getReplicate] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. Also is not used in the database. can be deleted. 
16) ****** [dbo].[getSampleChanged] just returns a value of 0 everytime. Doesnt do anything.
17) ****** [dbo].[getSampleMethod_byProtocolAcid] is not used anymore.
18) ****** [dbo].[getSampleMethod_fromSequences] is not used anymore. 
19) ****** [dbo].[getSampleMethod_S5] is used in a few places but the value returned is never valid and the variable the value is set to is not used. deprecated.
20) ****** [dbo].[getSampletype] has no dependencies. Not used.
21) ****** [dbo].[getSampletype2] has no dependencies. Not used. 
22) ****** [dbo].[getSampleTypeWash] has no dependencies. Not used. 
23) ****** [dbo].[getSEQUENCE_DateTime] looks incorrect? it grabs a previously used datetime if analysisstd is null or empty.. shouldnt it do that in the case of last cal when analysis std is not null or empty? Also has explicit calls to [PLASMATRAX] instance. 
24) ****** [dbo].[getSequence_Washmethod] this has a bug. When attempting to select a SampleTypeWash, a sample wash is returned because 'SampleType' is like 'Sample' and hits that case before it can make it to the 'SampleType' case.
25) [dbo].[getSequenceIndex] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX].
26) ****** [dbo].[getSequenceRun] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. Proc is also broken. Tries to set a VARCHAR value into a tinyint which causes the proc to rollback. Needs to be investigated. 
27) [dbo].[getStdBlank] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]
28) [dbo].[getStdPoint] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]
29) [dbo].[getStdVal] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
30) [dbo].[getStdWash] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
31) [dbo].[getStock] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
32) [dbo].[getUnit] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
33) [dbo].[getUser] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
34) [dbo].[IsAddSEQUENCE_Enable] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
35) ****** [dbo].[IsAutoRun] does not work. It attempts to set a TINYINT variable with a value of a varchar (RunType) which is either 'SC' or 'Auto'. This causes a failure when the proc is executed. 
36) [dbo].[IsM5StdEXT] always returns a value of 0. Not implemented. 
37) ****** [dbo].[IsSampleType_S5] has no dependencies. Is deprecated. 
38) ****** [dbo].[IsUserDevice_Enable] has no dependencies. uses old table names as well. Is deprecated. 
39) ****** [dbo].[select_BatchFile] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. SampleTypeDATA does not have  abatchfile parameter so this procedure will not work. No dependencies either. 
40) [dbo].[select_Calibrations] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
41) [dbo].[select_CCVFreq] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX].
42) [dbo].[select_FirstSequenceId] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
43) [dbo].[SEQUENCE_DATA_STD_VIEW] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name is not [PLASMATRAX]. 
44) [dbo].[select_ICVenabled] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name not [PLASMATRAX]. 
45) [dbo].[select_ICVWashEnabled] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name not [PLASMATRAX]. 
46) [dbo].[select_LastCalANALYSIS] has an explicit call to [PLASMATRAX] database. Causes issues when DB name not [PLASMATRAX].
